# README

## Background

​	This project ditches the single style swing and implements a relatively beautiful and functional student center in java + javafx. If you would like to try running this project, please ensure that your jdk version is jdk8.



## Install

​	All you need to do is make sure you have jdk8 on your computer and an IDE that supports running java programs such as IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code etc. Unzip our project into the folder of your choice and run `testRun.java` from the project to start your student center journey.



## Usage

​	You can follow the manual to explore the full functionality, but we would like to remind you that if you want to log in with your default account, please try `Forgot Password` on the login screen, which will prompt you for our default student account and password, which you can use to access the main screen.
